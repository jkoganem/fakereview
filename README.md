## Overview

With the explosion of LLMs and NLP methods, AI-generated text has become ubiquitous on the internet. This presents several challenges across many contexts, ranging from plagiarism in the academic setting to misinformation on social media and its consequences in electoral politics. With this in mind, we explore a range of classical statistical learning classifiers as well as deep learning based transformers to detect AI-generated text. 

## Structure of repository

- `raw data` contains a readme citing our data sources, and our exploratory data analysis notebooks. It does not contain the raw data itself, which was too large to add to the repository. Instead, the `processing.ipynb` notebook can be used to reconstruct our dataset from the source datasets that we link.
- `code` contains our Python scripts for XGBoost and fine-tuning, which are intended to run on a powerful computing cluster.

## Our Dataset

We compiled 40000 human-generated and 40000 AI-generated text snippets sourced from various contexts and models. 

- Product Reviews generated by GPT-2 from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/fake-reviews-dataset
).
- Essays generated by a range of models, also from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset
).
- News articles generated by [Grover](https://github.com/rowanz/grover/tree/master
).
- Wikipedia intros generated by GPT-3 Curie, from a Hugging Face [repo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aadityaubhat/GPT-wiki-intro
).
