Each folder includes results of fine-tuning our classifier on data from certain contexts. Folder names specify which contexts were used for training. 

For example, the results in `reviews_wiki_2024-09-26_16-53-00` contain validation results for each epoch of a model trained only on `reviews` and `wiki` data.

Folders with the prefix `baseline` contain the results of models where *only* the classification head was trained.
